Q1:-Write a program to print all the composite numbers between a and b?
Sample Input:
A = 12
B = 19
Sample Output 14, 15, 16, 18	
ans:-
public class CompositeNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int A = 12;
        int B = 19;

        System.out.print("Composite numbers between " + A + " and " + B + ": ");
        for (int i = A; i <= B; i++) {
            if (isComposite(i)) {
                System.out.print(i + " ");
            }
        }
    }
    public static boolean isComposite(int num) {
        if (num < 4) return false; 
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                return true; 
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
Q2:- Write a program to print the numbers from M to N by skipping K numbers in between?
Sample Input:
M = 50
N = 100
K = 7
Sample Output: 50, 58, 66, 74, …..	
ans:-
public class NumberPrinter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int M = 50;
        int N = 100;
        int K = 7;

        for (int i = M; i <= N; i += (K + 1)) {
            System.out.print(i + (i + (K + 1) <= N ? ", " : ""));
        }
    }
}
Q3:-Write a program to enter the marks of a student in four subjects. Then calculate the total and aggregate, display the grade obtained by the student. If the student scores an aggregate greater than 75%, then the grade is Distinction. If aggregate is 60>= and <75, then the grade is First Division. If aggregate is 50 >= and <60, then the grade is Second Division. If aggregate is 40>= and <50, then the grade is Third Division. Else the grade is Fail	

ans:-
import java.util.Scanner;
public class StudentGrade {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
         System.out.print("Enter marks for Subject 1: ");
        int subject1 = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter marks for Subject 2: ");
        int subject2 = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter marks for Subject 3: ");
        int subject3 = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter marks for Subject 4: ");
        int subject4 = scanner.nextInt();
        int total = subject1 + subject2 + subject3 + subject4;
        double aggregate = (total / 400.0) * 100; 
                String grade;
        if (aggregate > 75) {
            grade = "Distinction";
        } else if (aggregate >= 60) {
            grade = "First Division";
        } else if (aggregate >= 50) {
            grade = "Second Division";
        } else if (aggregate >= 40) {
            grade = "Third Division";
        } else {
            grade = "Fail";
        }
      
        System.out.println("Total Marks: " + total);
        System.out.println("Aggregate Percentage: " + aggregate + "%");
        System.out.println("Grade: " + grade);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
Q4:-Write a program to calculate tax given the following conditions:
a.	If income is less than or equal to 1,50,000 then no tax
b.	If taxable income is 1,50,001 – 3,00,000 the charge 10%
tax
c.	If taxable income is 3,00,001 – 5,00,000 the charge 20% tax
d.	If taxable income is above 5,00,001 then charge 30% tax
ans:-
import java.util.Scanner;
public class TaxCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter your income: ");
        double income = scanner.nextDouble();
        double tax = calculateTax(income);
        System.out.println("Your tax is: " + tax);
    }
    public static double calculateTax(double income) {
        double tax = 0;
        if (income <= 150000) {
            tax = 0;
        } else if (income <= 300000) {
            tax = (income - 150000) * 0.10;
        } else if (income <= 500000) {
            tax = (150000 * 0.10) + (income - 300000) * 0.20;
        } else {
            tax = (150000 * 0.10) + (200000 * 0.20) + (income - 500000) * 0.30;
        }
        return tax;
    }
}
