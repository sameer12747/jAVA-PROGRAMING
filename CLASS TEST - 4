Q1:-Develop a Java program to create a class called Employee with private instance variables employee_id, employee_name, and employee_salary. Provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify the id and name variables, but provide a getter method for the salary variable that returns a
formatted string.	
class Employee {
    private int employee_id;
    private String employee_name;
    private double employee_salary;
    public Employee(int id, String name, double salary) {
        this.employee_id = id;
        this.employee_name = name;
        this.employee_salary = salary;
    }
    public int getEmployeeId() {
        return employee_id;
    }
    public void setEmployeeId(int employee_id) {
        this.employee_id = employee_id;
    }
    public String getEmployeeName() {
        return employee_name;
    }
    public void setEmployeeName(String employee_name) {
        this.employee_name = employee_name;
    }
    public String getEmployeeSalary() {
        return String.format("$%.2f", employee_salary);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp = new Employee(101, "John Doe", 75000.50);
        System.out.println("Employee ID: " + emp.getEmployeeId());
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + emp.getEmployeeName());
        System.out.println("Employee Salary: " + emp.getEmployeeSalary());
        emp.setEmployeeId(102);
        emp.setEmployeeName("Jane Smith");
        System.out.println("\nUpdated Employee Details:");
        System.out.println("Employee ID: " + emp.getEmployeeId());
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + emp.getEmployeeName());
        System.out.println("Employee Salary: " + emp.getEmployeeSalary());
    }
}
Q2:-Develop a Java program to create a class Vehicle with a method called speedUp(). Create two subclasses Car and Bicycle.
Override the speedUp() method in each subclass to increase the vehicle's speed
differently.
class Vehicle {
    int speed = 0;
    void speedUp() {
        System.out.println("The vehicle speeds up.");
    }
    void displaySpeed() {
        System.out.println("Current speed: " + speed + " km/h");
    }
}
class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    void speedUp() {
        speed += 20;
        System.out.println("The car speeds up by 20 km/h.");
    }
}
class Bicycle extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    void speedUp() {
        speed += 5;
        System.out.println("The bicycle speeds up by 5 km/h.");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle car = new Car();
        car.displaySpeed();
        car.speedUp();
        car.displaySpeed();
        Vehicle bicycle = new Bicycle();
        bicycle.displaySpeed();
        bicycle.speedUp();
        bicycle.displaySpeed();
    }
}
